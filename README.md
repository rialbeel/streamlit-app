## Introduction

This is an introduction to my streamlit application for Stats 21

it consists of the following tools for simple exploratory data analysis:

1. File uploader tool that will read in a csv file and display relevant information
2. An input widget that will select a specific column from the csv file
3. The selected column will then show a five number summary or will show the proportions of each category

Before using the application, please read through the requirements.txt and ensure that you have all the listed packages.

Enjoy!
